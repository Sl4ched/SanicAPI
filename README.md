# SanicAPI
I made sanic api that includes get,post,delete requests and i used fetch api to test how it's works on frontend side


---


AS BACKEND I USED SANIC SANIC-MOTOR AND SANIC-CORS

---


SANIC IS A ASYNC BACKEND FRAMEWORK FAST AND EASY TO HANDLE REQUESTS

---


AS DB I USED MONGODB

---


SANIC-MOTOR IS REALY EASY TO USE WHILE YOU NEED TO CONNECT MONGODB 

---


ALSO I USED SANIC-CORS CAUSE I WANTED TO FETCH DATA FROM ANOTHER PORT

---


AS FRONTEND I USED REACTJS I KNOW ITS LITTLE BIT OLD FASHION BUT AS BACKEND DEVELOPER I THOUGHT THIS WILL DO AND I USED TAILWIND TO STYLE THE SITE AND LOTS OF REST API :)
